- 본 논문에서는 labeled data과 unlabeled data로부터 학습하는 일반적인 문제를 다루며, 이는 보통 semi-supervised learning, transductive inference로 표현된다.
- 기본적인 접근 방법은 이미 알려진 labeled data과 unlabeled data간의 내재적인 관계를 파악하는 것으로, 

We consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled
data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. A principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design
a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the
intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled
points. We present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution.
Our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data.
