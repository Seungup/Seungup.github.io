    "A Coupled CO2 and Wastewater Treatment Process to Create High Value Gas/Oil Field Chemicals\tCO2 mineralisation\tOther\tThe technology combines salts present in industrial wastewater with carbon dioxide in an electrochemical cell to mineralize the carbon dioxide in the form of high-value oil-field chemicals such as acids and carbonate salts. This coupled process simultaneously removes CO2 and desalinates the wastewater or brine. The amount of CO2 that can be mineralized is dependent on the salt content of the wastewater. Designed as a process operated from a modular facility, the technology can be easily scaled based on wastewater volume treatment requirements. The modular design also means the technology will be easy to transport and simple to operate on site.\tPilot commercial project\n",

Researchers at RTI International will conduct feasibility testing on the use of carbon as a reducing agent for CO2 utilization. A reducing agent (reductant) is an element or compound in a chemical reaction that reduces (adds electrons to) another species; the reducing agent then becomes oxidized (loses electrons) in the process. The chemistry for this proposed CO2 utilization process is based on the reverse Boudouard reaction, in which carbon reduces CO2 to produce carbon monoxide (CO). The reduced product (CO) can then be used to create other chemicals.\tTesting facility\n",
